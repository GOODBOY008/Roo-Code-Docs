# Roo Code 3.11.13 Release Notes (2025-04-11)

This release includes several terminal enhancements, improved diff error display, file context tracking, and various fixes.

## New Terminal Settings (thanks KJ7LNW!)

Six new configurable settings were added to improve terminal reliability:

*   **Terminal command delay setting** - Configurable millisecond delay after command execution for terminals with timing issues. Uses `PROMPT_COMMAND='sleep N'` or appends `start-sleep` to PowerShell commands.
*   **PowerShell counter workaround setting** - Adds a counter to PowerShell commands to ensure proper output capture.
*   **Clear ZSH EOL mark setting** - Sets `PROMPT_EOL_MARK=""` to prevent interpretation issues when output ends with special characters.
*   **Oh My Zsh integration setting** - Sets `ITERM_SHELL_INTEGRATION_INSTALLED=Yes` to enable compatibility with Oh My Zsh. (experimental)
*   **Powerlevel10k integration setting** - Sets `POWERLEVEL9K_TERM_SHELL_INTEGRATION=true` to enable compatibility with Powerlevel10k theme. (experimental)
*   **ZDOTDIR handling setting** - Creates a temporary directory for ZDOTDIR to ensure proper zsh shell integration without modifying user configuration. (experimental)

For detailed information about these settings and shell integration troubleshooting, see [Terminal Shell Integration](/features/shell-integration).
